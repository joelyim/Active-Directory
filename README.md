# Active Directory

## Objective

This project provides an educational platform to learn and apply Active Directory installation and configuration in a simulated environment. The project leverages tools like Splunk, Atomic Red Team, and Kali Linux to demonstrate and study data flow, security events, and attack techniques within a domain. This project aims to enhance proficiency in Active Directory, Splunk, and Windows Administration while highlighting the importance of network diagram creation and documentation.

### Skills Learned

- Installed and configured Active Directory on Windows Server, promoted servers to domain controllers, and created users/groups within Active Directory.
- Deployed Splunk on Ubuntu, configured Splunk Universal Forwarder and Sysmon on Windows to collect telemetry, and created indexes for data storage.
- Set up NAT networks in VirtualBox, configured static IP addresses, and verify network connectivity using CIDR notation.
- Conducted brute-force attacks using Kali Linux and Crowbar on RDP to test system security.
- Installed and utilized Atomic Red Team to simulate MITRE ATT&CK-based attacks, generate telemetry, and identify visibility gaps.

### Tools Used

- VirtualBox: Virtualization platform for creating and managing virtual machines.
- Splunk: SIEM tool for collecting and analyzing machine data and security logs.
- Sysmon: Windows tool for detailed system activity logging and monitoring.
- Kali Linux: Penetration testing OS used for ethical hacking and brute-force attacks.
- Atomic Red Team: Framework for simulating attacks based on MITRE ATT&CK techniques.
